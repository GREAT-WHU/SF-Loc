## What is this? 

**SF-Loc** is vision-centered mapping and localization system, based on the map representation of visual structure frames. We use **multi-sensor dense bundle adjustment (MS-DBA)** to generate the visual structure frames and sparsify them through co-visibility checking, leading to lightweight map storage. On this basis, multi-frame information is utilized to achieve high-recall, accurate user-end **map-based localization**.
